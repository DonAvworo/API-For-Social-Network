Steps to create application

Step 1 â€” App Directory Structure. 

    Create a new directory for the routes
        mkdir routes:
        - inside the routes folder create a new file called index.js :
        * touch index.js
            * this is the file that will contain all the api routes for the application
            * will require all the api path and export them to be used in the application
            * will require express and create a router for the application
            * will use the api folder path to create the router for the application

     
        - Create a new folder for the api routes  
        * mkdir api (this is the folder that will store all the api routes) 
            ___ Create a new file for the api routes
                * touch index.js
                    * this is the file that will contain all the api routes for the application
                    * will require all the api routes and export them to be used in the application
                    * will require express and create a router for the application
            
            ___ Create a new file for thoughts routes
                * touch thoughts-routes.js
                    * this is the file that will contain all the thoughts routes for the application
                    * will require all the thoughts routes and export them to be used in the application
                    * will require express and create a router for the application
                    * will require the thoughts controller to use the methods in the controller
                    * will use the router to create the routes for the application
                    * will export the router to be used in the application
                    * will use the .get method to get all the thoughts and the .post method to create a new thought for the application database

            ___ Create a new file for users routes
                * touch users-routes.js
                    * this is the file that will contain all the users routes for the application
                    * will require all the users routes and export them to be used in the application
                    * will require express and create a router for the application
                    * will require the users controller to use the methods in the controller
                    * will use the router to create the routes for the application
                    * will export the router to be used in the application
                    * will use the .get method to get all the users and the .post method to create a new user for the application database

    
    Create a new directory for the connection
        mkdir connection or confiq
        - inside the connection folder create a new file called index.js :
            * touch connection.js
                * this is the file that will contain the connection to the application database
                * will require mongoose to connect to the application database
                * will export the connection to be used in the application
                * will use the .connect method to connect to the application database
                * will use the .env file to store the connection string for the application database using mongoose to connect 
                    Example: mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/social-network-api', 
                    { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useCreateIndex: true, useFindAndModify: false });


    Create a new directory for the controllers
        mkdir controllers
        - inside the controllers folder create a new file called users-controller.js and thoughts-controller.js :
            * touch users-controller.js and thoughts-controller.js
                - this is essentialy the file that will contain all the methods for the application database (users and thoughts)
                * this is the file that will contain all the controllers for the application
                * will require all the controllers and export them to be used in the application
                * will require the models to use the models in the controllers eg. User and Thought
                * will use the .get method to get all the users and thoughts and the .post method to create a new user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .put method to update a user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .post method to create a new reaction for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a reaction for the application database
                * will use the .post method to create a new friend for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a friend for the application database  
                * will export the controllers to be used in the application
            
            * touch thoughts-controller.js
                - this is essentialy the file that will contain all the methods for the application database (thouths and reactions)
                * this is the file that will contain all the controllers for the application
                * will require all the controllers and export them to be used in the application
                * will require the models to use the models in the controllers eg. User and Thought
                * will use the .get method to get all the users and thoughts and the .post method to create a new user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .put method to update a user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a user and thought for the application database
                * will use the .post method to create a new reaction for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a reaction for the application database
                * will use the .post method to create a new friend for the application database
                * will use the .delete method to delete a friend for the application database  
                * will export the controllers to be used in the application

    Create a new directory for the models
        mkdir models
        - inside the models folder create a new file called index.js :
            * touch index.js
                * this is the file that will contain all the models for the application
                * will require all the models and export them to be used in the application
                * will require mongoose to create the models for the application database
                * will use the .Schema method to create the models for the application database
                * will use the .model method to create the models for the application database
                * will export the models to be used in the application
        
        - inside the models folder create a new file called User.js:
           * touch User.js (this is essentially the Schema for the User model)
                * this is the file that will contain the User model for the application

                *   Example: moment().format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a');
                * will use time stamp to create the date for the application database

    Create a new directory for the seed
        mkdir seed
        - inside the seed folder create a new file called index.js :
            * touch index.js
                * this is the file that will contain the seed for the application
                * will require mongoose to create the seed for the application database

                * will use the .connect method to connect to the application database
                * will use the .disconnect method to disconnect from the application database
                * will use the .create method to create the seed for the application database
                * will export the seed to be used in the application
        
        - inside the seed folder create a new file called user-seeds.js :
            * touch user-seeds.js
                * this is the file that will contain the user seed for the application
                * will require mongoose to create the user seed for the application database

                * will export the user seed to be used in the application

        - inside the seed folder create a new file called thought-seeds.js :
            * touch thought-seeds.js
                * this is the file that will contain the thought seed for the application
                * will require mongoose to create the thought seed for the application database

                * will export the thought seed to be used in the application

    Create a an environment file
        - inside the root folder create a new file called .env :
            * touch .env
                * this is the file that will contain the environment variables for the application
                * will require dotenv to create the environment variables for the application database
                * will use the .config method to create the environment variables for the application database
                * will export the environment variables to be used in the application  
               
                ========================================================================================
                IMPORTANT!!! - DO NOT FORGET TO ADD THE .env FILE TO THE .gitignore FILE
                ________________________________________________________________________________________
                
                Also IMPORTANT ABOUT THE .env FILE
                ________________________________________________________________________________________
                * this is the file that will contain the connection string for the application database
                * will use the .env file to store the connection string for the application database using mongoose to connect 
                    Example: mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/social-network-api', 
                    { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useCreateIndex: true, useFindAndModify: false });
            

Step 2 â€” write codes 
 
add dependencies to package.json
    * npm init -y
    * npm i express
    * npm i mongoose
    * npm i dotenv
    * npm i nodemon
    * npm i dateformat



    {
        "dependencies": {
          "dateformat": "^5.0.3",
          "dotenv": "^16.0.2",
          "express": "^4.18.1",
          "mongoose": "^6.5.4",
          "nodemon": "^2.0.19"
        }
      }

       
    
# add the port to the list of ports to be scanned
ports.append(port) 
# add database entry
db.add_port(
    port, 
    host = host, 
    service = service, 
    state = state, 
    reason = reason, 
    version = version, 
    script = script)

# scan the ports
for port in ports:
    # scan the port
    scan_port(port)

# close the database
db.close()
